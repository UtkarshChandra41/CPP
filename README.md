# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains categorized C++ programs to help learn and practice core programming concepts. The code is organized into folders by topic for easy navigation.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `basic/` – Basic syntax, input/output, variables
- `loops/` – `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loop examples
- `conditionals/` – `if`, `else`, `switch` statements
- `functions/` – Function definitions, parameters, recursion
- `arrays/` – Arrays, vectors, and related algorithms
- `pointers/` – Pointer basics and pointer arithmetic

*(Add or remove folders based on your actual structure.)*

## 🛠️ How to Compile

Use g++ to compile individual programs. For example:

```bash
g++ -o loops/loop_example loops/loop_example.cpp
./loops/loop_example
